# LA_Metro_Bike

The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, North Hollywood and the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.


Metro Bike Share is a partnership between Metro and the City of Los Angeles.

Metro is a multimodal transportation agency that is really three companies in one: a major operator that transports about 1.5 million boarding passengers on an average weekday on a fleet of 2,200 clean air buses and six rail lines, a major construction agency that oversees many bus, rail, highway and other mobility-related building projects, and it is the lead transportation planning and programming agency for Los Angeles County.
